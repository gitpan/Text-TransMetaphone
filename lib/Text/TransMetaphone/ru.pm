=head1 NAME

Text::TransMetaphone::ru - Transcribe Russian words into IPA symbols.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is used by L<Text::TransMetaphone> and need not be used
directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Text::TransMetaphone::ru module implements the TransMetaphone algorithm
for Russian.  The module provides a C<trans_metaphone> function that accepts
an Russian word as an argument and returns a list of keys transcribed into
IPA symbols under Russian orthography rules.  The last key of the list is
a regular expression that matching all previously returned keys.

A C<reverse_key> function is also provided to convert an IPA symbol key into  
a regular expression that would phonological sequence under Russian orthography.

=head1 STATUS

The Russian module has limited awareness of Russian orthography, no alternative
keys are generated at this time.   The module will be updated as more rules
of Russian orthography are learnt.

=head1 COPYRIGHT

This module is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the same terms as Perl itself.

=head1 BUGS

The /i substitution switch isn't working for Cyrillic in some cases.
Fixes will be provided in a future release.
